# Chay
* Languages I've used before: Nim, C#, C/C++, C++ with .NET (horror), Python
* I got into this, when I was around 14-- I'm now in my early 20s, and still loving the ability to create and help others! If you have any questions and just happened upon my page, feel free to reach out or ask something! Even though I might not know the answer, perhaps we can brainstorm together. For, I often reached out to people on here with questions for my own projects.
* Without those people, I would've probably never figured out how easy it actually was to circumvent the encryption of certain websites-- Someone shared with me how they guessed the keys, and I expanded on that to inspect the actual JS on the website. It no longer had to be a guess, if they changed anything, since I could simply follow what they wrote and figure out how the keys were created.
