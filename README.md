* Languages I know: Nim, C#, C++, Python
* I got into software development, when I was around 14; I've mainly started working in Nim, but my language of choice is C#. I love Linux, and I only use Windows for modded games, which don't work very well in WINE. Sadly, I'm stuck with a dualboot setup rather than a vm, due to the bulkinesss of newer GPU's and the lack of cooling for two separate cards.
